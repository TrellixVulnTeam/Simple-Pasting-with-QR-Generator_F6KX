Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,[25][26] notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[27]</p><p>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[28]</p><p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[29] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
